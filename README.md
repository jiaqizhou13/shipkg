Introduction for the dataset of shipkg

These images are mainly obtained from Google Earth, and the rest are from two remote sensing image datasets, HRSC2016 and FGSCR-42. Compared to previous datasets, we mainly collect images of active warships rather than retired warships, including 14 types of ships, belonging to 8 categories. These images come from 9 famous harbors in 3 countries, namely, the United States, Japan, and Russia.


For the collected ship images, we utilize the oriented object detection method Oriented R-CNN to obtain rotated bounding boxes and then obtain a total of 347 slices of ship targets, with a slice size between 300×30 and 1500×300.


Types of ship are as follows:

• Guided-missile destroyer (Arleigh Burke class destroyer & Zumwalt-class destroyer)
  
• Helicopter Destroyer (Izumo-class helicopter destroyer & Hyūga-class helicopter destroyer)

• Littoral Combat Ship (Independence-class littoral combat ship & Freedom-class littoral combat ship)

• Aircraft Carrier (Nimitz-class aircraft carrier & Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier & Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier)

• Amphibious Assault Ship (Wasp-class amphibious assault ship & America-class amphibious assault ship)

• Dock landing ship (Whidbey Island-class dock landing ship)

• Amphibious transport dock (San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock)

• Cruiser (Ticonderoga-class cruiser)
